# Evernote

https://michaeldkeyes.github.io/evernote/

Evernote clone made with Vue and the Quill Editor. It uses Firebase for the backend. I tried using Vuetify but the documentation was poor and it was such a headache trying to figure out how to use it that it was much faster for me to just style everything myself.
